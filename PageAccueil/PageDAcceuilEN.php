        <p>Because aircraft's pilots are demanding with their precision while flying,
            <strong class="infinite">Infinite Measures</strong> works every day to meet their requirements and to offer
            them <strong>precise</strong> tests that really match with their needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because aircraft's pilots need to be <strong>certain</strong> of their condition in order not to endanger
            themselves, <strong class="infinite">Infinite Measures</strong> provides them with reliable
            <strong>tests</strong>.
        </p>

    <h3><strong>Several tests</strong> for <strong>the best</strong> estimation of the ability to tackle stress</h3>
    <div id="heartRate">
        <img src="Images/heart rate.png" alt="Logo fréquence cardiaque">
        <p>
            The <strong>heart rate</strong> is the best stress gauge. By learning how to control one's heart rate,
            one learns how to control one's stress level in critical situations.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="temperature">
        <img src="Images/Temperature.png" alt="Logo température">
        <p>
            Associated with the heart rate, the <strong>temperature</strong> is an efficient gauge of the stress level
            and allows to gather further informations about the physiological reaction of the patient to a highly
            stressing situation. This can help to prevent issues which could have heavy consequences (fainting fit for
            example).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="reaction">
        <img src="Images/Time.png" alt="Logo temps de réaction">
        <p>
            During a flight, each seconds is important, so a pilot must have the slightest <strong>reaction time</strong>
            in order to fly serenely.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="sound">
        <img src="Images/Sound.png" alt="Logo reproduction de son">
        <p>
            Infinite Measures offers to assess the hearing of the pilots as well. This assessment is possible thanks to
            the ability of the patient to <strong>reproduce the frequency of a sound</strong>.
